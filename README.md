# What is this?
This is my collection of dot files which I use to build my Linux systems and 
control how they are configured.

For more information on NixOS the Linux distribution I use and also nix
the packaging tool and language that most of this repository is writen in
go to [NixOS Web site](https://nixos.org/).

# Warnings
Do not apply these settings on your own system, they are incomplete. I have put them up here for 
inspiration on creating your own setup.

# Folder structure

```
|-[modules] -- Contains all the modules that make up this configuraiton
|-[lib] -- Contains my utility functions
|-[roles] -- Contains roles which can be applied to machines.
|-[wallpapers] -- drop images into this folder to add to wallpaper cycle.
|-LICENSE - MIT License file.
|-flake.nix - Contains the main nix flake.
|-shell.nix - Creates a nix shell with required tools to install.
```

# HowTo
These dot files can be installed onto a system by 1 of two ways:

## Already running nixos system
If you have setup a nixos system with a configuration.nix file its possible to switch over to this nix config with
the following commands:

```shell
nix-shell
nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#
```

The above assuse your computer name matches one of the configurations in the flake.


## Via install media
You can also install this via the install media in the nix-install repo by doing the following:

- Boot off the install media.
- Create the partition schedume and mount it to /mnt
- Run `nixos-install --flake github:wiltaylor/dotfiles`

## sys tool
I created a helper script that is located in modules/core/scripts.nix file in this repo. It handles a number of different
maintanance functions for me (saves me having to remember a heap of commands):

```
Usage:
sys command

Commands:
clean - GC and hard link nix store
update - Updates dotfiles flake.
update-index - Updates the index of commands in nixpkgs. Used for exec
find - Find a nix package (searches all overlays)
find-doc - Finds documentation on a config item
find-cmd - Finds the package a command is in
apply - Applies current system configuration in dotfiles.
exec - executes a command from any nix pkg without permanantly installing it.
vm {config} - Builds one of the machine configs and runs it in a vm.
```
